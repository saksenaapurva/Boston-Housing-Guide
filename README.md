# Boston-Housing-Guide

•	Performed descriptive analysis on the Boston Housing dataset and implemented the KNN algorithm from scratch to model the relationship between the median home value and home attributes.

•	Developed generic functions to perform feature normalization and k-fold cross-validation to achieve an average RMSE of 0.76 and avoid overfitting
